Installation Guide for Visual Studio
====================================

First you nedd to download and install the latest version of SFML:
http://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php

Similarly to SFML's installation, you add the library to any Project as follows:

Open the Project Settings by right-clicking on the Project, then selecting Properties.

Navigate to C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories and add the path to the include folder (eg. "D:\GUI-lib-master\include")

Then navigate to Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories and add the path to one of the two folders under lib (either x86 or x64), depending on what architecture you are compiling for (eg. "D:\GUI-lib-master\lib\x86")

Lastly, after navigating to Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies add a new line and insert "GUI.lib" below SFML's .lib files.
